## General Information

---

This project was to build a single page application using HTML & CSS that was a survey form for a restaurant. This project was part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) coding basics courses and was one of the first projects I ever built.

## Technologies Used

## Features

---

Survey Form<br/>
Alerts when fields empty<br/>
Resizing

- If the screen size for the application is changed to 800px wide or less the page shifts to an image of a zombie dinner.

## Screenshots

---

Survey form:
![Home Page](/UI/screenshots/2.png 'Home Page')

Form error showing a feild was left empty:
![Features](/UI/screenshots/1.png 'Features')

What happens to the page when the screen becomes less than 800px wide:
![less thank 800px](/UI/screenshots/3.png 'less thank 800px')

## Setup

---

### Dependencies

- React
- React-Dom

### Run Locally

1. Clone repo locally
2. Run `npm install` in your bash/command line
3. Run `npm start` in your bash/command line
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

`"npm start" : "react-scripts start"`,

The app is built using `create-react-app` so this command Runs the app in Development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

<!-- ### `"npm run dev": "concurrently "nodemon server" "npm run start"`,

For running the server and app together I am using concurrently this helps a lot in the MERN application as it runs both the server (client and server) concurrently. So you can work on them both together. -->

## Usage

---

At the moment there is no database connected to the page, simply a form, however I plan on connecting it to a databse soon.

## Project Status

---

Project is: In Progress

## Room for Improvement

---

This project is over a year old now and having learned a few more things I'm re-visiting it to add some upgrades. I have already added a backend API to start but will need to add functionality as well.

Improvement Thoughts:

- Improve layout for better viewing
- Give functionality to links
- Create a SPA using React

To do:

- [x] Add React components
- [x] Create the Walk-in Dead Diner website
- [x] Link to database
- [x] Add Authentication
