## General Information

This project was to build a single page application using HTML & CSS that was a survey form for a restaurant. This project was part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) coding basics courses and was one of the first projects I ever built.

## Technologies Used

![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=HTML5&logoColor=white)
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-61DAFB.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=React&logoColor=black)

## Features

Survey Form<br/>
Alerts when fields empty<br/>
Resizing

- If the screen size for the application is changed to 800px wide or less the page shifts to an image of a zombie dinner.

## Screenshots

Survey form:
![Home Page](/UI/screenshots/2.png 'Home Page')

Form error showing a field was left empty:
![Features](/UI/screenshots/1.png 'Features')

What happens to the page when the screen becomes less than 800px wide:
![less than 800px](/UI/screenshots/3.png 'less than 800px')

## Setup

### Run Locally

1. Clone repo locally
2. Run `npm install` in your bash/command line
3. Run `npm start` in your bash/command line
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Available Commands

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

<!-- `npm run dev`


Runs the server. Open [http://localhost:XXXX](http://localhost:XXXX) to view it in your browser. I am also using nodemon.
-->

## Usage

At the moment there is no database connected to the page, simply a form, however I plan on connecting it to a database soon.

## Project Status

Project is: In Progress

## Room for Improvement

This project is over a year old now and having learned a few more things I'm re-visiting it to add some upgrades. I have already added a backend API to start but will need to add functionality as well.

Improvement Thoughts:

- Improve layout for better viewing
- Give functionality to links
- Create a SPA using React

To do:

- [x] Add React components
- [x] Create the Walk-in Dead Diner website
- [x] Link to database
- [x] Add Authentication
